# CMPM121_HW2
UCSC's CMPM121 - HW2: Lighting and Particle Systems in Unity

## 1. Lights
Lights Used:
- Spotlights on the central lights
- Point Light on the wall lights
- Area Light for the front display refrigerator
- Directional Light for the sun/moon

## 2. Lighting Transitions
Made a UI button to toggle the lights within the cafe from 100% -> 50% -> 0%

Bonus - Also made a Day Night cycle that plays thoughout the scene

## 3. Particle System
Used a 2D Texture Emitter to make a steam effect on the cup of tea directly in front of the player

## 4. Polish/changes
I didn't change the scene much from HW 1 as I feel I achieved a nice level of polish already.  I ended up removing the skybox I had implemented however as the sun/sky didn't move or change with the Day and Night cycle code.
